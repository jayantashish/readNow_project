He would place a one-rupee coin on the stumps, and if Tendulkar managed to bat throughout the session without getting dismissed, he would earn the coin. This practice helped develop Tendulkar's focus and determination.
      
      At the age of 16, Tendulkar made his debut for the Bombay (Mumbai) cricket team in domestic cricket, showcasing his remarkable talent. His performances in domestic cricket soon caught the attention of the national selectors, and in 1989, he made his debut for the Indian cricket team.

    <h3><b>The Legacy and Retirement</b></h3>
    <img class="clip-circle" src="img/retirementsachintendulkar.jpg" alt="" width="310">

    <div class="align">

    <p>When India hosted 2011 World Cup, the country knew that it would be his last chance to lift the trophy. It would have been unfair to the game if its greatest icon never got the chance to lift it. The stage was set on 2nd April 2011, when India took on Sri Lanka in the World Cup final.

        Sachin Tendulkar had the chance to score his 100th International century to lift the World Cup at his home ground. But sports don’t have a script, Sachin got out for just 18 and it looked that his dream will never come true. This time, his teammates did not let him as Dhoni and Gambhir took India over the line as India won the World Cup.
        
        The team lifted Sachin Tendulkar on their shoulders. Virat Kohli said that Sachin Tendulkar had carried the burden of Indian cricket for so long so it justified them carrying Sachin on shoulders now.
        
        The nightmare came true,
        While the 100th century vs Bangladesh, made sure his name will be immortal, but it was a fact that his body was a mere mortal like us. When he announced his decision to retire in 2013, it became a national news.
        
        No matter how beautiful the story is, it has an end. Even this story had to end someday, Sachin retired on 14th November 2013.  The nation was crying when Sachin Tendulkar was giving his farewell speech, he called it a day by showing his respect to the 22 yards which gave him a status of God.
        
        The crowd thanked him by chanting “Sachin Sachin…”</p>
