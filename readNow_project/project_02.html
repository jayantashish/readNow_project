    <h1> <b> NIKOLA TESLA </b> </h1>
    <h3>(1856-1943)</h3>
    
    <img class="clip-circle" src="img/nikola_tesla.jpg" alt="" width="350">
    
    <P>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system.</P>
    <hr color="Black">

    <h2><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h2>
    <p>Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856, in what is now Croatia. He came to the United States in 1884, and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to George Westinghouse. His 1891 invention, the "Tesla coil," is still used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New York City on January 7, 1943.</p>
    
    <h2><b>EARLY LIFE</b></h2>
    <P>Famous Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in what is now Smiljan, Croatia. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was likely spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a priest. After studying in the 1870s at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt); the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague, Tesla began preparing for a trip to America.</P>

    <h2><b>FAMED INVENTOR</b></h2>
    <img class="clip-circle" src="img/Teslathinker.jpg" alt="" width="350">

    <p>Tesla came to the United States in 1884, and soon began working with famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison. The two worked together for a brief period before parting ways due to a conflicting business-scientific relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly different personalities: While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was a commercially out-of-tune and somewhat vulnerable, yet extremely pivotal inventor, who pioneered some of history's most important inventions. His inventions include the "Tesla coil," developed in 1891, and an alternating-current electrical system of generators, motors and transformers—both of which are still used widely today.</p>
    <h3>Some of Tesla's Inventions and Accomplishments</h3>
    <div class="align">
    <ul>
        <li> <B>Alternating current:</B> In his rivalry with Thomas A. Edison, Tesla invented the electric motor, theorized and promoted the use of alternating current electric power and demonstrated it could be used safely.</li>
        <li><B>Hydropower:</B> George Westinghouse used Tesla's patents to create hydroelectric power generation at Niagara Falls.</li>
        <li> <B> Radio and television:</B> In 1891 Tesla invented a transformer for the production of high frequency and high voltage electricity. The Tesla coil is used in every radio and television.</li>
        <li> <B> Remote control:</B> He won a patent dealing with the remote control by radio of moving vessels and vehicles, laying the groundwork for wireless telemechanics, robotics and satellite communication.</li>
        <li> <B>Radar:</B> The people who built the first primitive RADAR units in 1934 were following principals, mainly regarding frequency and power level, that were first established by Tesla in 1917.</li>
        <li> <B> Wireless energy transmission:</B> The people who built the first primitive RADAR units in 1934 were following principals, mainly regarding frequency and power level, that were first established by Tesla in 1917.</li>
        <li> <B> X-rays:</B> German physicist Willhelm Röntgen is credited widely with the discovery of X-rays in 1895, but Tesla's own experiments highlighted some of the inherent dangers of using radiation on human flesh.</li>
        <li> <B> Robotics:</B> Tesla imagined that, in the future, a race of robots would be able to perform labor safely and effectively.</li>
        <li> <B>Earthquake oscillator:</B> In 1898, Tesla claimed he had built and deployed a small oscillating device that, when attached to his office and operating, nearly shook down the building and everything around it. Realizing the potential terrors such a device could create, Tesla said he took a hammer to the oscillator to disable it, instructing his employees to claim ignorance to the cause of the tremors if asked.</li>
        <li> <B>Tesla Coil: </B> Developed in 1891, the Tesla coil was used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla used this device in different configurations to conduct innovative experiments in his development of many other inventions.</li>
        <li> <B>Polyphase Induction Motors:</B> Nikola Tesla conceived the basic principals of the polyphase induction motor in 1883, and had a half horsepower (400 watt) model by 1888. Most AC motors are induction motors. Induction motors are favored due to their ruggedness and simplicity. In fact, 90% of industrial motors are induction motors.</li>
        <li> <B> Death Ray:</B> Tesla debunked any kind of "ray" weapon, but instead postulated what could be considered a lazer. "My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind."</li>
        <li> <B>Tesla Motors:</B> Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers in Silicon Valley who wanted to prove that electric cars could be better than gasoline-powered cars. Tesla’s engineers first designed a powertrain for a sports car built around an AC induction motor, patented in 1888 by Nikola Tesla, the inventor who inspired the company’s name.</li>
        <li><B>Fluorescent Bulbs:</B>Of course he didn't invent light itself, but he did invent how light can be harnessed and distributed. Tesla developed and used fluorescent bulbs in his lab some 40 years before industry "invented" them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><b>DEATH AND LEGACY</b></h2>
    <img class="clip-circle" src="img/Nikola_Tesla_statue_in_Zagreb.jpg" alt="" width="310">

    <p>Poor and reclusive, Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, at the age of 86, in New York City—where he had lived for nearly 60 years. His legacy, however, has been thriving for more than a century, and will undoubtedly live on for decades to come.

        Several books and films have highlighted Tesla's life and famous works, including Nikola Tesla, The Genius Who Lit the World, a film created by the Tesla Memorial Society and the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Serbia; and The Secret of Nikola Tesla, which stars Orson Welles as John Pierpont Morgan (J.P. Morgan). In recent years, a street sign entitled "Nikola Tesla Corner" was installed in honor of the famous inventor, near the 40th Street-6th Avenue intersection in New York City.</p>
    <h2><b>WARDENCLYFFE PROJECT</b></h2>
    <p>Over the past several years, several nonprofit organizations, high-profile individuals, municipalities and Tesla enthusiasts have been involved in a different kind of effort to uphold Tesla's legacy: A project to preserve Tesla's still-standing, still-abandoned New York laboratory, Wardenclyffe, and turn it into a museum of the famous inventor's work. For more than a decade, New York's Nikola Tesla Science Center has been working to gain momentum and, subsequently, funding for preserving Wardenclyffe. Since then, the lab's ownership has been passed through several hands, and public interest for the project has slowly but steadily been growing.

        Interest escalated in February 2009, when the Wardenclyffe site was posted for sale, for nearly $1.6 million. For several years, the Tesla Science Center worked diligently to raise funds for the lab's preservation. The TSC was able to purchase the property in 2013 and plans to turn the site into a science museum.</p>
